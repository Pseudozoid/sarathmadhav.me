**Hey I'm Sarath** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sophomore computer science and engineering student who likes to code and play video games.

# Interests:
- low level programming
- ricing my [arch system](https://github.com/Pseudozoid/linux-configs)
- anything and everything open source

This site is still a WIP so be on the lookout for new stuff :)
