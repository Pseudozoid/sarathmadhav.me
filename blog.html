        <p class="post-content">
		      I was hit by a case of dengue and I've been down at the hospital for the past week. 
          My time under sickness gave me a lot of time to reflect on myself and the decisions I've 
          made in my life. When you're sick everything takes place in a vaccum and there's this 
          brief, sort of special sense of time standing still outside your limitted perception. The 
          only feeling that comes close to what I mean is skipping out on school while you were young 
          for some lame reason and just sitting home doing nothing. There's a definite sense of missing 
          out but there's also a weirdly endearing sense of peace. 
          <br></br>I spent a lot of my time at the hospital watching youtube videos of old thinkpads 
          being restored and arch linux installations being thrown around. One thing that still stays 
          rooted in my mind is the ever looming prospect of making a UNIX shell of my own. That is the 
          ultimate project in my mind right now that I need to get working on again. In my mind getting 
          it done is the first step of breaking out of my long term rutt that I've seemed to have 
          fallen into during this semester.
